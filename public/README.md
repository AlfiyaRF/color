## Requirements:
- The project  must have at least three "pages." These can can be three different html files, or one file that links to all three "pages".
- Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc)
- Each page must validate at validator.w3.org.
- Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least two unique views
- Must have at least 4 images on one of your pages.
- Each page must be styled. The goal is not to impress, but to show competence. So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules. But peer-review with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.
