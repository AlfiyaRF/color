    		  <p>What is color? Color is a feature of the perception of different waves of light by the eye. Each wave corresponds to a spectrum; in turn, it is a carrier of information.</p>
          <p>Color is a wave of a certain kind of electromagnetic energy that, after being perceived by the human eye and brain, is transformed into color sensations.</p>

    		<p>Color is not available to all animals on Earth. Birds and primates have full color vision, the rest, at best, distinguish between certain shades, mostly red.</p>
    		<p>The appearance of color vision is associated with the image of nutrition. It is believed that in primates it appeared in the process of searching for edible leaves and ripe fruits. In further evolution, the color began to help a person identify the danger, memorize the terrain, distinguish plants, determine the approaching weather by the color of the clouds.</p>
